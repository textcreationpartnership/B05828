            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>The firſt Part.</head>
                  <p>As <hi>Moſes</hi> his Preſervation from the Tyranny of the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Edict and Inquiſition, <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.15. was a moſt eminent work of the Divine-all-ruling Providence; ſo was it a moſt heroicall and Religious Act of his both affectionate and holy Parents; For though Nature (not aſſiſted by any other guide) will ſufficiently enſtruct Parents both to deſire, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour (and is therefore often found to be very ingenious to contrive wayes for) the preſervation of their Iſſue: Yet Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion both ſharpens thoſe deſires, which threatned and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended hazards might either dull or divert, and alſo ſeconds and backs thoſe endeavours which might be ſtopped and ſtayed with an infidell perſwaſion, and an unbeleeving beleife of an impoſſible event. Nature is full of jealouſies and fears, and ſo apt to make men doubtfull and remiſſe; Religion is made up of hope and ingenuity, and renders Men clear, confident,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:179652:3"/>and reſigned. For Faith in emminent dangers, both ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adds reſolution to the ſcrupulous and faint wiſhings and wouldings of falſe and fearfull, and alſo diligence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy to the recoyling and revolting indeavours of the ſame trayterous and declining nature; Nature will not hold out, unleſſe Religion command in cheife; terrors and threats in the loſſe of life or eſtate will lay her off, and cow her, unleſſe the auxiliaries of grace be called in for aſſiſtance; and when both theſe concur in this ſubordination, the effect is not onely a work of Nature, but an act alſo of Faith. And this ſeems to be the caſe betwixt <hi>Moſes,</hi> and his Parents here; affection and humanity told them they ſhould endeavour his preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and the way for that was, by his concealement: Religion goes higher, and commanded them thus to doe; and alſo aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them that what they did thus in obedience to her dictates, ſhould proſper and ſucceed, according to their affectionate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and inclinations. Nature ſet forth the enterprize; Faith kept it a foot. Nature ſaith, This I would doe: Faith ſaith, Goe on, and proſper; Nature is right ſet, and never ſayles, when ſhe is ſubject to the counſels and commands of Grace.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But Faith not well grounded, is either a fancy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion; or raſhneſſe and preſumption: and therefore it was not ſufficient to denominate this their concealement an <hi>act of Faith,</hi> becauſe the concealers were perſwaded, and therefore preſumed that it would take, and prove according to their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, (for a ſtrong perſuaſion, may be a ſtrong and ſtrange deluſion; a fantaſticke Faith is but the beleeving a lye, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.11.) unleſſe alſo they had ſufficient Motives and Arguments to bottome and found that perſwaſion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Now that <hi>Moſes</hi> his Parents had ſuch ſupports and grounds for their concealement; we have theſe following en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements, and conſiderations, to evidence to us, and ſecure our Faith, that what they did, was done (as the Apoſtle here declares) <hi>by Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Look then upon this contrivance with the Eye of Faith, and you will finde, by ſearching into the rule of Faith,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:179652:3"/>that it was a commanded work, and deſigne of Faith; For,</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Conſider it in <hi>theſi,</hi> that muſt needs be looked on as an effect and production of Faith, which hath an expreſſe reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from Heaven for its foundation, and Gods truth and goodneſſe for its warranty and ſecurity. Now <hi>Moſes</hi> his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents knew the Propheticall praedictions of dying <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Joſeph;</hi> the former recorded <hi>Gen.</hi> 48.21. the latter <hi>Gen.</hi> 50.25. and both of them relating to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> Deliverance, the accompliſhment whereof they fully beleeved, and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended as approaching and drawing nigh.</item>
                     <item>2. Conſider it in <hi>hypotheſi,</hi> that the ſet time was come for the <hi>Hebrews</hi> Deliverance, and that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that he might be the Deliverer of his Brethren; they had high and cogent Arguments to engage their beleife. For the former, They knew that <hi>Pharaohs</hi> rage was neer the height, and his tyranny almoſt at the full, and that God would declare his Power, in reſtraining and ſuppreſſing <hi>Pharaohs, Exod.</hi> 9.16.17. that it was Gods uſuall Method to leade captivity captive, to confound the policies of Tyrants, when they ſeem to them moſt prudent; and to ſubdue their power, when they appeare moſt potent to themſelves, and moſt terrible to his perſecuted people; and withall, <hi>That God was a fure and preſent refuge in due time of trouble,</hi> Pſal. 9.9.10. <hi>and</hi> Pſal. 46. And for their confirmation (beſides theſe contemplative) they had experimentall grounds: For, <hi>de facto,</hi> God (through the Religious temper of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Midwives, and the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of compaſſion, and common humanity in ſome neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring <hi>Egyptians,</hi>) had preſerved many <hi>Hebrew</hi> Infants from that barbarous Maſſacre which <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had projected, and by his cruel <hi>Edicts</hi> ordered; and therefore it was very obvious for <hi>Moſes</hi> his Parents (from thoſe received axiomes, and atteſted experiments of Gods goodneſſe) to draw concluſions of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy towards themſelves, and their tender Infant, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to apply them to themſelves in his behalfe. For the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, That <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould be preſerved for his Brethrens De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, beſides what was contained and folded up in the generall Propoſitions of holy Faith, <hi>Moſes</hi> his Parents,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:179652:4"/>(though we have no expreſſe ſpeciall Revelation in that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord that they had) had ſome more diſtinct and clear Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from God; which St. <hi>Steven Acts</hi> 7.20. ſeems to report, when he tells us, that <hi>Moſes</hi> was, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which the vulgar reades <hi>Gratus Deo:</hi> Tremel. <hi>Dilectus Deo:</hi> and the <hi>Genevah</hi> enclines to this; and then this expreſſion is Argumentatively full to our purpoſe: Thus, God at <hi>Moſes</hi> his Birth, did repreſent to his Parents; and they according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did apprehend in him ſomewhat extraordinary, for which he would deliver and preſerve him; then God manifeſted he ſhould be his Favourite and Agent. <hi>Beza</hi> tranſlates it, <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitus venuſtus,</hi> which alſo is home enough; and the rather, becauſe it fully accords with <hi>Philo's</hi> reports concerning them, that they ſaw <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, a greater beauty or Majeſty of countenance, then would belong to a private or ordinary Perſon; and therefore that God had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned him for ſome High and Honourable employment, ſome rare and extraordinary work and ſervice. Certainly, there appears very often in the countenances of Men, rayes and ſtreames of Wiſedom and Prudence, of Authority and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, of quickneſſe and clearneſſe of Spirit, of magnanimity and greatneſſe of courage, that as from ſuch evidences (we in our Vulgar account) conclude them hopefull and promiſing; ſo where all theſe (as all theſe were in <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſo notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to his Parents) are conſpicuouſly ſhining in a moſt illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious, tranſcendent, and divine manner; there God hath, as it were, marked them out for Places and Offices of eminency, renowne, and dignity: Yet if this relation of St. <hi>Steven</hi> may fall ſhort of a convincing proofe to this aſſertion, That <hi>Moſes</hi> was to be the Deliverer of his Brethren, and that God had diſcovered ſo to his Parents, then <hi>Moſes</hi> his own ſuppoſition <hi>Acts</hi> 7.25. will concludingly inferr it; For from thence it is moſt clear, That this was early revealed to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and that it was alſo ſufficiently and convincingly declared to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> (and <hi>Moſes</hi> his Parents were ſuch, and ſo it was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, and remonſtrated to them alſo, and reaſon there is, both in reſpect of their relation to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and their noble
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:179652:4"/>extraction, to beleeve rather to them, then to the generality of the <hi>Hebrews</hi>) though the Scripture of the Old Teſtament be ſilent in it; for otherwiſe how could <hi>Moſes</hi> (unleſſe we will ſuppoſe what we may not, that his ſuppoſition was ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe) ſuppoſe, that they would have underſtood it, unleſſe this future contingent had been preſaged to them? Or why ſhould <hi>Moſes</hi> reprove them, that they did not underſtand, unleſſe it had been duty in them to underſtand; and not to underſtand culpable? and this it could not have been, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it had been propoſed to them; and every propoſall of God is an <hi>object of Faith;</hi> and the beleife of every ſuch propoſall, an <hi>act of Faith.</hi> And therefore from theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes it is evident, That what <hi>Moſes</hi> his Parents did, they (as it is here ſet down) did <hi>by Faith.</hi>

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:179652:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>operations and what he doth not freely, he doth not as a man, but as <hi>a horſe and mule, which have no underſtanding;</hi> and we are forbidden to be ſuch, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.10. for it is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall for the will of man to move freely, rationally, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berately; and this freedom, or liberty of the will, is an eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall of humanity; and the proper <hi>act</hi> of that freedom is <hi>Election,</hi> which is expoſed both to <hi>coaction</hi> and <hi>compulſion:</hi> (<hi>Voluntas non cogitur;</hi> for that which is compelled, is againſt the will; and that which is againſt the will, is not willed: It is true, the will may be letted, changed, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>actions</hi> thereof compelled, that is, thoſe inferiour faculties which are moved by the will; but the immanent actions of the will, that is to deliberate, will and chooſe cannot be ſo) and alſo to neceſſitation and determination to one; For if the will be determined by the Phyſicall and ſpeciall influence of outward cauſes; then morives were in vain, reaſon in vain, deliberation in vain, all perſwaſions and threats in vain: but therefore are theſe uſed, becauſe man hath a power of <hi>Election,</hi> that he may deliberate and <hi>act</hi> indifferently, and either doe, or not doe; or doe this, or the contrary. For what exerciſe have we of our wills, if we <hi>act</hi> not voluntary? And how <hi>act</hi> we voluntarily, if we be neceſſitated abſolutely? And to what end and deſigne are thoſe terrors, and promiſes of the Lord, the danger we ſhall incurr by our diſobedience, and the reward we ſhall reape by our obedience, if they be not as rationall motives, and have not with them a perſuaſive efficacy? It is true indeed, that the will often miſtakes, and errs in her choyce, putting bitter for ſweer, evill for good, and one the contrary: But this proceeds not from any forfeiture of what was naturall to the will, (and all, or certainly very few excepted, confeſſe that <hi>Adam</hi> had true and entire liberty) but from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rution of nature, or the naturall faculty depraved, (which is a contracted contagion) whereby we are averſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed to good, we are refractory and rebellious to the very Laws of Nature, as well as of Grace; of right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as holy Religion; and we are prone and ſtrongly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:179652:10"/>to obſerve and follow the deſires and delights of the carnall ſenſitive appetite, and to ſatisfie the luſts of the fleſh; for the underſtanding is full of ignorance and darkneſſe, during this ſtate of corruption, of pride and contradiction, againſt all ſacred and ſaving truth; the will is full of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and oppoſition againſt that which is good, the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence full of impurity and ſophyſtry, the heart of folly and madneſſe, of infidelity and hypocryſie; and therefore no wonder if every imagination, fancy, and conception of the heart be unto evill, and that continually: Yet even in theſe aptneſſes, inclinations, and prejudices, the will moves free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and <hi>acts</hi> by choyce: For as Angels, and good Spirits, by a moſt free agency, doe good, and nothing but good, becauſe their underſtandings are taken up with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation and ſatisfaction, and their affections with the deſires and delight of good onely: So Devills, and wicked men long and thirſt, purſue and proſecute ſin, by chuſing the evill, and refuſing the good, <hi>having the underſtanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them, becauſe of the blindneſſe of their heart,</hi> Epheſ. 4.18. and ſo allowing and approving of ſinne and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe; So that whether the object be choſen good or evill, the will acts <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>A.</hi> Doubtleſſe their ſufferings here, have the appellation of the reproch of Chriſt upon the ſame account, that Saint <hi>Pauls reproches</hi> are ſtiled, <hi>the afflictions of Chriſt,</hi> Col. 1.24. for, as Chriſt could not ſuffer perſonally before he aſſumed our Nature, and took our fleſh; ſo neither was it poſſible for him to ſuffer after the Reſurrection of his Fleſh, and that his Body was Glorified: For, on the Croſſe, his ſufferings had their determination, and period, with that <hi>Conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum eſt,</hi> It is finiſhed, <hi>Iohn</hi> 19.30. And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>Chriſt being rayſed from the Dead, dyeth no more, death hath no more dominion over him,</hi> Rom. 6.9. and if not Death, then no penalties, or miſeries, which are but either the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingers, and Fore-runners, or Attendants and Followers of Death.

                     </gap>, is all one; Chriſt, before his Incarnation, and after his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification, ſuffers, and is reproched; not in his Perſonall ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, as he was during his reſidence on Earth; but in his politick capacity; and in this conſideration, he was from all Eternity, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the ſame yeſterday, and to day, and for ever;</hi> and he ſuffers, and did alwayes ſuffer, when any part of his Body ſuffereth. As therefore in <hi>Moſes</hi> and his <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Chriſt myſticall was reproched; ſo in Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and the then Church of Chriſt, he was myſtically afflicted: Chriſt ever did, and now doth ſuffer in his Members; he ever did, and ſtill doth count their afflictions his own: God did ſo, (<hi>Iſay</hi> 63.9.) and ſtill doth ſo; witneſſe that Voyce from Heaven, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.4. <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me,</hi> ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by Chriſt: and <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>I am Jeſus, whom thou perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt</hi> in his Members; <hi>For he that toucheth them, toucheth the Apple of his Eye,</hi> Zach. 2.8. for he is the Head of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the Church; and the Head is ſenſible of the ſufferings of the Body? nay, the Church is expreſly called <hi>Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.12. <hi>For as the Body is one, and hath many Members, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:179652:12"/>all the Members of that one Body, being many, are one Body, ſo alſo is</hi> Chriſt. He ſaith not, <hi>Ita &amp; Chriſti;</hi> but, <hi>Ita &amp; Chriſt us, unum Chriſtum appellans caput &amp; corpus,</hi> Aug. de pecc. mer. lib. 1. cap. 31. ſo is Chriſt, ſo is the whole, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of Head and Members; the denomination is taken, not from the ſubordinate Members of the Body; but from the ſupreme, the Head; ſo is Chriſt, that is, Chriſt miſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall. And that this is the genuine meaning of this place, may be concluded from that we find expreſſed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Now to</hi> Abraham <hi>and his Seed were the Promiſes made; He ſaith not, And to Seeds, as of many, but as of one, And to thy Seed, which is Chriſt.</hi> And therefore, this moſt ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantly, and comfortably doth denote and aſcertain unto us, that cloſe union and conjunction betwixt <hi>Chriſt the Head, and the Church, his Bady;</hi> and from thence reſults that ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy and compaſſion of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in the ſufferings and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of his people and ſervants. Now, that the beleeving <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> (for otherwiſe this would not have been argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to them) had alſo this perſwaſion; there are beſides the fore-mentioned, two places in the Old Teſtament convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cingly to demonſtrate it. That place where <hi>David</hi> in ſpirit called [Chriſt] Lord; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.1. <hi>The Lord ſaid unto my Lord, &amp;c.</hi> My Lord indeed fiducially, and obedientially; but not excluſively: for it is plain, he was Lord over the Collective Body, <hi>the whole Iſrael of God,</hi> a Ruling Lord over his People, whereof <hi>David</hi> was but one, though a Chiefe one. And as <hi>David</hi> thus gives us an account of his Faith, That he expected a Meſſias, and beleeved that that Meſſias was the Head of the People, the Lord of the aggregated of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> ſo he aſſures us, that that perſuaſion was a part of the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Creed;</hi> for that whole <hi>Iſrael</hi> eſteemed and adjudged, that all projects and defignes to proſecute and oppreſſe the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of God, were conſpiracies and aſſociations <hi>againſt the Lord, and againſt his Anoynted,</hi> Pſal. 2.2. <hi>Moſes</hi> therefore did chuſe both Religiouſly, and Prudently, becauſe <hi>he eſteemed his and his Brethrens ſufferings, the reproch of Chriſt;</hi> a choice not of Faction, but Faith, becauſe of a ſtate and condition where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:179652:12"/>Chriſt his Lord was intereſted and concerned; yet <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> had not onely this motive of Faith to perſwade him to this choice; but he had another alſo, and that a powerfull one; <hi>For he had reſpect alſo to the recompence of the Reward,</hi> that is, beleeved the Deliverance of his People was approch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and they ſhould receive the promiſed Inheritance, <hi>the Land of Canaan,</hi> a Type and Figure of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>But what? doth Faith Eye temporall Objects? or, are temporalties as well as ſpiritualties taken into the cognizance of Faith? or, is that true Faith which moves for either of theſe reſpects? could</hi> Moſes <hi>fight the Lords Battells, and look for Pay, or Recompence? Is not this to be a mercinary Souldier, no Voluntiere? or rather, thus to act, Is it not to love our ſelves, and the reward; not the Lord and his Service?

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:179652:20"/>indeed, the true cauſe, both <hi>of his fear, and flying,</hi> was, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, that although he was then deſigned for to be the <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer of Iſrael;</hi> yet then, his Commiſſion to execute that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, and empower him, was not Sealed and Delivered; this was not done till after, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.9.10. <hi>Now therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, the cry of the Children of Iſrael is come unto me; and I have alſo ſeen the oppreſſion wherewith the Egyptians oppreſſe them.

For as I ſaid before, in that ordered ſlaughter of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> God, who is above all Law, having paſſed his ſentence, nulled the authority of any Law decreeing the contrary: ſo here, God, who is above all Government and Governours, having expreſly declared a change of the then Government, and the ſubſtitution of other Governors, did thereby licenſe and authorize all practiſes tending thereunto, and by his over-ruling ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, abſolved thoſe people from their Allegiance to their then Governours. Now that God had done ſo, appears, <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 1.2.3. &amp;c. and yet this can be no preſident, or Goſpel caſe now, becauſe Chriſt hath given rules for peaceable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanor, none for diſturbance of States. God then would have the Common-wealth in the Church; now the Church is in the Common-wealth; that is, Chriſt will have no man for his cauſe diſſeazed of his right, deprived of his Eſtate, depoſed from his Dignities; he ſettles his Goſpel in King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and States, without diſputing their forme or mode of Government, he came to give an Heavenly Kingdom; he leaves earthly Monarchies and Republiques in a quiet enjoyment of their powers and priviledges.</p>

O let us not any longer goe a whoring after our own ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, nor be led by the deceitfulneſſe of ſin; but having Faith to God-ward, we may turn from Idols, to ſerve thee the living God, and to wait for thy Son from Heaven; and in the mean time, receive, and welcome him in our Hearts and affections with Peace, that when he ſhall return to make inquiſition for blood, tranſgreſſion and ſin, we may by him, and that league and Covenant of Peace concluded with thee in him, be delivered from wrath to come, and for him receive forgiveneſſe of ſins, and Inheritance among them who are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Faith in him. O let us not have our portion with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleevers, nor our part with the diſobedient, for then we ſhall
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:179652:45"/>certainly periſh: but think upon us (O Lord) for good, that we may be ſaved with that remnant, who have their Robes waſhed and whitned in the blood of the Lambe, who have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated themſelves from the children of <hi>Belial,</hi> and Table of Devills, and keep themſelves unſpotted from the World; and ſo both they and we may be preſented in our Bodies, our Soules, and Spirits, holy, blameleſſe, and undefiled at the comming of our Lord. Holy God, keep as from the contagion of ſin, and ſinners; preſerve us in thy truth, and love, in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity and Communion of thy one true holy Catholique Church, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Seale of Gods Servants in our Forcheads, we may cry and ſing eternally, <hi>Salvation to our God who fitteth on the Throne, and to the Lambe,</hi> Amen.</p>

And ſo I marvaile whence ſome of the <hi>Jewiſh Doctors</hi> affirme, That <hi>Iephthah</hi> made his Daughter an Houſe out of the City, where he kept her recluſe and ſhut up from all Society; when as the <hi>Targum</hi> Reades it as we doe, <hi>to lament,</hi> and ſo they Interpret the <hi>[Lethannoth]</hi> and ſomtimes they Interpret the Word, <hi>to ſpeake of, or report concerning:</hi> and ſomtimes tranſitively, <hi>to celebrate, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe:</hi> Others Reade the words joyntly, as by a Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on copulative, <hi>(and.)</hi> thus <hi>(it ſhall ſurely be the Lords, and I will offer, &amp;c.)</hi> or more plainly, <hi>it ſhall be Lords, I will offer, &amp;c.</hi> or rather, <hi>for an Offering.</hi> And if this hold, which is the moſt received Reading, then we may conſequently with the <hi>Targum</hi> render the <hi>Lethannoth</hi> in the 40. <hi>Ver. to lament.</hi> And according to this conſtruction, it is moſt evident, that the condition of the Promiſe or Vow, was to offer it for a burnt Offering to the Lord: Now a burnt Offering did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily require the Death of the thing, or <hi>ſubject matter</hi>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:179652:48"/>ſo offered, <hi>Levit.</hi> 1. in ſeverall Verſes of that Chapter; and that <hi>Iephthah did accordingly performe this Vow, and obſerve the condition,</hi> expreſſe termes carry it, beyond all exception, in the 39. <hi>Verſe,</hi> where it is ſaid, <hi>He did with her accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Vow.</hi> But that which to me moſt ſtrongly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes this Opinion, is <hi>Iephtha's</hi> own Declaration (in the 35. ver.) and Profeſſion, <hi>I have opened my mouth to the Lord, and I cannot goe backe:</hi> which was as much as to ſay; <hi>My Vow is irrevocable, I cannot commute it, I cannot avoyd it:</hi> For to take away all doubts, let us remember there were two ſorts of Vowes; There was a ſingular Vow without an <hi>Anathema,</hi> or <hi>Interdict,</hi> and what was thus Vowed, might be redeemed by an apprizement, or valuation, either ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the worth of the thing vowed; or according to the ability of the Perſon vowing, as you may Reade, <hi>Levit.</hi> 27.1.2. &amp;c. till 13. &amp;c.

Iephthe.</hi> The Obſervations now follow.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Hence we Learne, how farr we are to imitate theſe Patternes. The holy Scriptures holds forth the Faith of Gods People, for our imitation; yet withall, ſhewes their faults, for our caution. The holy Spirit is that faithfull witneſſe, who approves their good deeds; but will not in any wiſe juſtifie their evill: <hi>Be ye followers therefore of them,</hi> yet onely, <hi>as they are followers of Chriſt Ieſus.</hi> In the ſame Mapp you have both the Maine Sea repreſented, wherein you may ſafely Sayle: And you have the dangerous Rocks, and Shelves of Sands Delineated, that you may avoide: So the holy Writ doth deeypher and approve what is exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:179652:49"/>good in thoſe God is pleaſed to inſtance in, <hi>That their light might ſo ſhine before men, that they ſee their good works, &amp;c.</hi> That <hi>whatſoever things are lovely, or of good report; if there be any vertue, or if any prayſe, to think on them,</hi> Phil. 4.8. and it ſets forth their infirmities, and prejudices, that we may learne to beware of them, that we preſume not too much on our own abilities, or on former aſſiſtances, leſt God <hi>ſubſtract</hi> his Grace from us, and leave us in our own hands, and then indeed we ſhall be in a ſad and miſerable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Therefore let us in all humility, be jealous and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious of our hearts, <hi>leaſt they be hardened through the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſſe of ſinne; and conſider our ſelves,</hi> as the Apoſtle fore-warnes, <hi>Galat.</hi> 6.1. And let us thus reaſon with our ſelves, theſe though honoured with an infallible Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall, a Teſtimoniall from Heaven for their Faith, have fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len; therefore let us feare, and walke circumſpectly, and be alwayes on our guard: <hi>Gedeon</hi> made an Ephah of Gold; <hi>Sampſon</hi> defiled himſelfe with Concubines; <hi>Iephthah</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably Vowed raſhly, and performed it more ſinfully. If theſe fell ſo groſſely, let not us flatter our ſelves with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit that we cannot ſinne; but rather frequently and feri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſider, and re-minde the Apoſtles Exhortation, <hi>Let him that thinketh he ſtandeth, take heed leſt he fall,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly.</hi> We may learne hence, <hi>to pay our Vowes unto the</hi> Lord; This Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hath afforded us, <hi>Habet hie er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror aliquam laudem fidei, quia Deum timuit, ut quod vove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat redderet, &amp;c.</hi> If any err in the ſimplicity of his heart, fearing truely leſt he ſhould offend God, (as <hi>Iephthah</hi> feared to break his Vow) and provoke him, I dare not conclude him wicked; but ſhall rather with St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> pitty and pray for his innocent miſtake. God, when he declares, <hi>that he will not be mercifull to them who offend of malitious wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe;</hi> doth thereby intimate, that an innocent errour, and a well-meaning miſtake, may obtaine mercy; If God did not take us with our pre judices and frailties, what would become of us? how could we eſcape? but bleſſed be our
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:179652:49"/>good God, who will receive the weake in Faith, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends that to us, and that ſhews he will doe it; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members that we are but fleſh, and in the midſt of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment remembreth mercy towards them who ſincerely feare him.</p>
               <p>The next in the Roll, is <hi>David,</hi> who in his Perſon was an eminent and illuſtruous Inſtrument of Gods glory, and his Peoples good; and therefore had that high Prerogative granted, beſides the Charactar of his Faith, to be a Type of Chriſt: And yet I conceive, that <hi>David</hi> is here to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtood in his Politick capacity, as he was the Chiefe King of Iſrael; and ſo under <hi>(David)</hi> the Apoſtle comprehends, and by <hi>(David,)</hi> underſtands all the whole Succeſſion of Pious Kings and Princes, who were Nurſing Fathers to Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael. By the way, I ſhall ſhortly re-minde you of one great remarkeable evidence of his Faith among many; that when he had but ſmall ſubſiſtence for himſelfe, yet he carefully, and bountifully provided for the Houſe of God; when he was in great want, (a ſhame to thoſe who in their great fulneſſe, let Gods Service ſterve, and his Place of Worſhip decay) and ſtraits; yet nothing muſt be wanting (ſuch was his Zeale) to Gods Houſe and Worſhip. You ſhall finde the Record, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22.14. <hi>Now behold, in my trouble:</hi> as our commonly uſed Tranſlation; <hi>in my poverty,</hi> as the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevah Bible; in my affliction,</hi> as Junius; <hi>in his trouble, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, and affliction,</hi> he was Zealous to promote, and advance Gods Service; He would put his Arme as farr as it could ſtretch, he would not draw back upon common Pleas, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, and as much as he could, he would doe good to the Houſe of the Lord.</p>
               <p>The laſt expreſſely nominated, is <hi>Samuel;</hi> and as under <hi>David,</hi> was comprehended all holy Kings; ſo under <hi>Samuel,</hi> is contained all holy Prophets, who is ſuppoſed firſt to Plant and Erect that Society; and then to Rule and Governe it, from 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.5. &amp; 10. And for this reaſon, becauſe he
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:179652:50"/>was the Founder, and the Rector, or Preſident of that Colledge. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> reckoned the ordinary diſcent of the Prophets from him, ſaying; <hi>Yea, and all the Prophets from</hi> Samuel, <hi>and thoſe that follow after, Acts</hi> 3.24. And upon the ſame ſcore, here it is ſaid, <hi>Samuel, and the Prophets.</hi>

               <p>You have ſeen the men; Now ſee their works: as were the men, ſuch was their ſtrength; their ſtrength in undertaking and performing noble Attempts and Acts; and their ſtrength in under-going and holding out againſt all, not onely diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and dangers; but alſo all ſorts of ſufferings and loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Their works follow them, which hath both purchaſed for them glory in Heaven; but alſo procured for them a never dying name and memory on Earth. <hi>O how great is thy goodneſſe, which thou haſt layd up for them that feare thee: which thou haſt wrought for them that truſt in thee, before the Souns of Men!</hi> (Pſal. 31.19.) glory and honour enough, even to ſatisfie the moſt boundleſſely ambitious ſpirit. But to begin with their Works, which thus followed them.</p>
               <p>Though it cannot be verified, That every one of theſe mentioned Worthies did all the mighty Works which are here Related; yet it is true of all of them, that they did ſome one or other of theſe <hi>noble Acts;</hi> or what was equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent for worth or excellency to them; For,</p>
               <p>Suppoſe that through Faith all of them <hi>did not ſubdue Kingdoms;</hi> yet ſome, many of them did; as the Iſaelites under the Conduct of <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> and the <hi>Iudges,</hi> (<hi>Ioſh.</hi> 11.12. &amp;c. and <hi>Iudges</hi> throughout) and <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.1. &amp;c. reduced thirty one Kingdoms in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting them to their Laws, and Governing them accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. And this was thus applicable to theſe preſent <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes,</hi> if before the Iſraelites could be peaceably Poſſeſſed of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and ſetled there, they muſt encounter many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties;
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:179652:50"/>then, <hi>Per varios caſus, per tot diſerimina terum;</hi> then they may conclude it to be their condition, not to be ſecure, that they ſhould find no oppoſition in their way to Heaven; many enemies to ſtop them in their way, and theſe not ſleight or contemptible; but Potent, as well as Numerous: and if <hi>through Faith;</hi> then not by frand and force; the Weapons of the true Iſrael of God are Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; and the War they manage againſt the rebell world, to reforme, not to ruine it, is Spirituall, and ſo hath the truth and denomination of an holy war, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. for they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued Kingdoms not by injuſtice, but by Righteouſneſſe. Thus it follows,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They wrought righteouſneſſe;</hi> not by unjuſt, unauthorized invaſions of others Rights and Poſſeſſions, to which they had neither juſt Title, nor lawfull authority; For, <hi>tolle ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitiam, &amp; quid ſunt magna regna, niſi magna latrociuia?</hi> as moſt of the <hi>Romans</hi> Conqueſts were, if ye will beleeve Saint <hi>Auguſtine;</hi> but theſe Conqueſts were for the innocent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of themſelves, and for the protection of the innocent, to preſerve themſelves, and reſcue theſe from Oppreſſion and Violence: neither were they any deſignes of Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Ambition, or deſire of change; but of obedience to God, who firſt intitled them to thoſe Inheritances, and then commanded them to enter, and take Poſſeſſion; and this not by a pretended imaginary whiſper, rather then ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion of the ſpirit; but by a Publique Edict, Decree, and Voyce from Heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They wrought Righteeouſneſſe,</hi> diſcharged their truſt in the Adminiſtration of that Authority and Power which God had put into their Hands: <hi>operati ſunt oa quae juſtitia re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirit:</hi> that is in plain Engliſh, They would doe you Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: or, <hi>Exercuerunt juſtitiam;</hi> they Executed Juſtice im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially, and juſtly; not by any Arbitrary Power, but by Rule and Law, and that an infallible one, <hi>being a terrour to the evill doers, and prayſe of the good,</hi> Rom. 12.3. and ſo both in their Perſonall and Politicke caozeities, <hi>they wrought Righteouſneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:179652:51"/>
               <p>But there is another notion of this Attribute, [they wrought Righteouſneſſe,] <hi>exercuerunt juſtitiam;</hi> Juſtice in this ſenſe imports, <hi>Mercy,</hi> and <hi>Almeſgiving,</hi> and ſo takes under it all the <hi>Acts of Charity.</hi> Thus its taken <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.21.25. <hi>The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous ſheweth mercy, and giveth. I have been young, and now am old: yet have I not ſeen the righteous forſaken, nor his ſeed begging bread.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.9. <hi>He hath diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, he hath given to the poor: his righteouſneſſe endureth for ever: his horne ſhall be exalted with honour.</hi> And from all theſe different ſenſe, the reſult is the ſame; That is the duty of the truely faithfull, to oppoſe and oppugne what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is contrary to Piety and Juſtice, and to protect and propugne what is conducing and ſubſervient thereto; No War is good, but where the Cauſe is good; No Conqueſt juſt, unleſſe the Ground be juſt: Juſtice ought to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred juſtly, with a cleare indifferency, without reſpect of Perſons; and all Juſtice ſhould be tempered with Mercy, and executed to the ends and purpoſes of Charity: And as he that doth Righteouſneſſe, is Righteous; ſo none but he that ſuffers for Righteouſneſſe, is a Chriſtian ſufferer. It is not enough to conſecrate a Man a Martyr, to ſuffer what they doe; but to ſuffer for the Cauſe of Righteouſneſſe, that makes a Martyr, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 3.13.14. &amp; 4.15.16. this is indeed the right, the good old way to obtaine the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obtained Promiſes;</hi> that's not, <hi>Semen promiſſum,</hi> for as yet he was not exhibited; the fulneſſe of time was not come: but <hi>terram promiſſam,</hi> 2 Type of Heaven, they had ſeizure of the Land of Canaan; and this they obtained, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they wrought Righteouſneſſe, and in their way cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated all oppoſition: no comming to Heaven, but by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the conditions whereon it is promiſed, ſubduing our rebellious wills, and unclean affections, and by doing righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, <hi>hac itur ad ſuperos:</hi> The way to obtaine Heaven, is to ſubdue ſin, and work Righteouſneſſe; the way is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, when theſe are not in conjunction: And thus <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:179652:51"/>Ex eo ſtudio, eventus ſequitur;</hi> they obtained what they ſought for, and required; becauſe they did that which God commanded and required of them, and all theſe they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained not, <hi>ſimul &amp; ſemel,</hi> at once; but occaſionally, as their reſpective exigents did require, ſome one way, ſome another, as they found them in the dayes of their Pilgrimage: for ſome of them were ſo hard put to it, that they were forced <hi>to ſtop the mouthes of Lyons,</hi> leſt their widened jawes ſhould devoure and encloſe them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[They ſtopped the mouthes of Lyons.]</hi> Thus <hi>Sampſon rent the Lyon roaring againſt him, as he would have rent a Kid,</hi> Judges 14.5, 6. Thus <hi>David reſcued a Lambe from a Lyon, and when he aroſe</hi> in revenge againſt him, <hi>he caught him by his Beard, and ſmote him, and ſlew him,</hi> 1 Sam. 17.35. Of <hi>Beuaiah</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>he ſlew a Lyon in the midſt of a Pit in time of Snow,</hi> 2 Sam. 23.20. But moſt ſignally and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vably, this is held forth in <hi>Daniels</hi> great Deliverance, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.22.23. And this was very conſiderable and uſefull to theſe preſent <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and to all ſucceeding Chriſtians. God many times ſtops the ſury, rage, and ſeirceneſſe of their moſt eruell and malitious Adverſaries, <hi>putting hooke: in their noſes, bridles in their lips, and turning them back,</hi> Iſay 37.29. reſtraining their violence, and ſettering their ſury, and chaining up their madneſſe; when they are hot upon miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheife, he will either ſend his Angels, to ſtop them in their purſuite, or divert them; or infatuates them, ſtricking them with blindneſſe, or an Army of Vermine to encounter them; or elſe with the rod of his mouth, and the breath of his lips, he will tame and temper them, <hi>that the Wolfe ſhall dwell with the Lambe, and the Lyon ſhall eate ſtraw with the Oxe,</hi> Iſay 11.6.7.8. And as God will be a deliverer thus from unreaſonable men, whom in theſe reſpects our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour calls <hi>Wolves,</hi> Mat. 10.16. <hi>David,</hi> Lyons, preying young Lyons, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 57.4. &amp; 58.6. Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Beaſts of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> Doggs; ſo will our Lord Ieſus defend us againſt the roaring Lyon, the Devill, <hi>who walks about ſecking whom he may devoure,</hi> 1 Peter 5.8. This great one, who hath all
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:179652:52"/>the other Lyons to prey for him, is ſo bafled with the Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> that he may roare, but he cannot devoure; he may aſſault, but he cannot take, unleſſe you yeild: If you face him, he flyes; if you reſiſt, he runs; though he be a malitious, implacable enemy, he is a ſpoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, cowed, and conquered enemy: Chriſt hath overcome him for us; and ſo he may ſhew his teeth, but he cannot bite; he may aſſault, he cannot take you, unleſſe you betray your ſelves into his hands.</p>
               <p>But they obtained, as much as this upon another account, they <hi>[quenched the violence of Fire,]</hi>

The Hiſtory is famouſly known, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.16.17.24.25. and ſo I ſhall not here adde more, but how farr it concerned theſe <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and the after Chriſtians; ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it affords this Obſervation: That if the Children of God be expoſed to Tyranny, he will ſubdue the ſpirits of Princes, and refraine the feirceneſſe of men; he is the ſame God in Power, his Hand is not ſhortned; feare not therefore, if thou art his, then his promiſe is good to thee, <hi>When thou paſſeſt through the Waters, they ſhall not overflow thee; When thou walkeſt through the fire, thou ſhalt not be burnt, neither ſhall the flames kindle upon thee,</hi> Iſay 43.2.

               <p>
                  <hi>[They eſcaped the edge of the Sword,]</hi> the Deſtroying Bloody Sword paſſing through a Land.

But here is one Deliverance more, which though we have over-leapt, yet we muſt not paſſe by it, for its the ground of all the fore-going; And that is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Out of weakneſſe were made ſtrong.]</hi> Some indeed Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it, Of bodily frailties, and infirmities, they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered from dangerous and tormenting diſeaſes; whereof <hi>Hezekiah</hi> is a ſtrong proofe, <hi>Iſay</hi> 38. <hi>Convaluit de infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate;</hi> A deadly diſtemper had ſeized on him, and nothing but Faith, and the Prayer of Faith prevailed for his reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; this ſaves the ſick, <hi>Iames</hi> 5.15. <hi>Maet.</hi> 8.13. But I conceive it may juſtly be underſtood of all kind of deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſtraites, diſſiculties, and hazards, when they were at a loſſe, not knowing which way to turne; Faith findes them a way, directed and eſtabliſhed them. So <hi>Iunius</hi> enclines, and therefore (becauſe ſo the word is uſed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.20.) reads thus the words, <hi>In rebus infirmiſſimis divinitus fuerunt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmati:</hi> When all was thought to be gone, and the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe done, Faith fayled them not, but ſupplyed them with hope, reſolution, and courage. And ſo Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> refers this to the reduction of the <hi>Iewes</hi> out of the Babilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Captivity, which was, when their eaſe was deſperate,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:179652:53"/>if we look onely at their then condition, their ſtate and juncture of affaires, which the Church alſo Celebrated ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, and acknowledged, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126.1. <hi>When the Lord turned againe the Captivity of</hi> Zion: <hi>we were like them that Dreame.</hi> And ſo <hi>Theophilect in loc.</hi> applying hereunto <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiels Viſion of the Dead Bones,</hi> Ezek. 37.1.2. &amp;c. But,</p>
               <p>Laſtly, The laſt Enemy, <hi>Death,</hi> is yet to be deſtroyed; And this alſo Faith hath done, and that not by the Faith of the ſtronger party, but of the weaker Veſſell: For it thus lyes,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Women received their dead, rayſed to life againe:]</hi> weak women, ſtrong in Faith, obtained great favours; witneſſe the widow of <hi>Sarephath,</hi> or <hi>Sarepta,</hi> 1 Kings 17.22. Luke 4.26. for although this high favour might ſeem to be the immediate effect of <hi>Elijahs</hi> Prayer, and this vertue to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from his Devotion; yet the widows Faith acted her part, and concurred in the production of this effect: And herein her Faith was evident, that it obliged her with her ſmall ſtock and pittance, to ſupply the Prophets preſent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, being aſſured that God, even in that Famine, would releive her, and recompence her Charity: So that her Faith was the <hi>Cauſa protataretica,</hi> the externall moving, and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitively provoking Cauſe, that which both moved <hi>Elijah</hi> to entercede, and enclined God to be more favourable to his Petition; even becauſe ſhe through her Faith working by love, was <hi>ſubjectum capax,</hi> a proper ſubject to receive ſuch a mercy. And this alſo is ſeconded and confirmed by the <hi>Shunamites</hi> Son twice received; Once when life was given him, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.17. And then again when reſtored to her, in the 36.37. <hi>Verſos,</hi> after Death; her Charitable Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, iſſuing from Faith, obtained this double Conceſſion: This the Pſalmiſt declareth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.8. <hi>For thou haſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered my Soule from Death, mine Eyes from teares, and my Feet from falling.</hi> And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> experimented, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9.10. <hi>But we bad the ſentence of Death in our ſelves, that we ſhould not truſt in our ſelves, but in God which rayſeth

               </p>
               <p>But good <hi>Works</hi> have uſually the fate to be miſ-interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, good men to be flandered, and a good cauſe to be perſecuted, and hated. <hi>Becauſe I follow that which good is</hi> (ſaith David) <hi>therefore evill men purſue me with deadly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred.</hi> And the Apoſtle fully ſatisfies us herein, in that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive definition, or Aphoriſme, <hi>They that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, muſt ſuffer perſecution;</hi> that is, <hi>from abſurd, and unreaſonable men.</hi> The world hated Chriſt, and hated all his; it perſecuted them, and ſtill perſecutes them: <hi>In the World ye ſhall have tribulation,</hi> was our Saviours prediction to his Diſciples; not as they are ſingle Perſons, but as Diſciples: And hereupon it follows, That eminent Profeſſors, are emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Sufferers, famous as well for their Paſſive, as Active Obedience; and Recorded as well as made glorious by their patience and perſeverance in their moſt ſhamefull and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full executions.</p>

               <list>
                  <item>1. The Apoſtle had formerly ſpoken of <hi>David, Samuel, and the Prophets;</hi> and after the mention of them, this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Particle <hi>[others]</hi> follows; ſo that this <hi>[others]</hi> ſeems neceſſarily to be others from them premiſed.</item>
                  <item>2. The Apoſtle ayming in this induction to bring down the ſeries of the faithfull till the preſent Age, muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily in this his induction, and deductions thence, ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend from the firſt times pitched on, then the ſucceeding, till the preſent be taken in; which courſe is both agreeable to an induction as ſuch, and to this ſcope and concluſion from it. Thus it is apparent, he begins at <hi>Abel,</hi> and ſo paſſeth to <hi>Enoch,</hi> his Succeſſor in the Faith; So to <hi>Noah, Abraham,</hi> the <hi>Patriarkes,</hi> the <hi>Judges,</hi> the <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets;</hi> and ſo downwards ſtill to the following Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which was the time of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> they ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Kings;</hi> and ſo I think that theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries ſet down here, relate unto theſe Perſecution, which the <hi>Lewes</hi> after their return endured under. <hi>Autiochus Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes,</hi> one of the Succeſſors of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great in <hi>Syria,</hi> about two hundred years before the comming of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> in the Fleſh. The Records of whoſe miſchievous deſignes and horrid cruelties, are reſerved in the Books of the <hi>Maccabees;</hi> which becauſe they have fallen under ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition, cenſures: and ſeverities, I ſhall by the way (and the digreſſion may perhaps be uſefull) adde ſomething in reſc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to thoſe Writings. And firſt I ſhall ſuppoſe, and grant, That they are not any part of the Writings of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> commended to us in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> as the Oracles of God, and Dictates of his Spirit. And ſecondly, That the <hi>Lewes</hi> had not any ſuch eſteem of them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore never received them into their Canon of Holy Writ. But then in the next place, it is moſt certain, That they have been, and ſtill are generally reputed, and taken for an Hiſtory which may be very uſefull in the Church of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:179652:54"/>God, though not for the confirmation of any Article of Faith, or deciſcion of any controverſie in Pointe of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; yet for the edification of the Church, to bring down the Church Story after the Writings of the Prophets, till Chriſt and his Apoſtles lived: And therefore the Church of God hath judged them worthy to be incerted in our Bibles, and annexed to the Books of the Prophets, as a confirmation, and continuation of the Hiſtoricall part of the Old Teſtament, to acquaint us with the State of the Affaires of the Church then, and as Chriſts comming: And yet to prevent miſtakes, have noted them with the marke of <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> and by that Character hath excluded out of the number of Canonicall Books.

                     </gap>, he was touched, touched to the quick, deeply with the feeling of our infirmities; and then, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this notation of the Word, the ſenſe is, They had ſuch a ſharps ſenſe of their ſad condition, that as Chriſt, ſo their ſoules were ſorrowfull, exceeding ſorrowfull, even unto Death. Sometimes it ſignifies, gaining and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning flatteries and ſeducements with faire words, and large promiſes. Thus the Derill tempts; and ſo he tempted Chriſt, by giving him in overture the Publique Faith of his Kingdome, <hi>Matthow</hi> 4.9. and then thus they were tempted; this Tyrant <hi>Antiochus,</hi> beſides his menaces, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and arts of violence, endeavoured by flattering perſwaſions and propoſalls, to ſeduce them to a deſertion of, and defection from their Laws and Religion; a method which proves very ſucceſſefull, and never miſſeth, when di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to worldly, meane, and vulgar tempers: Tell them but of great Eſtates and Revenues for their revolt, &amp;c. then <hi>per ſaxa, per ignes;</hi> every obſtacle ſhall be removed; and then too as <hi>Lalius</hi> in the Poët, they are fit for any enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize; <hi>Pectore ſi fratris, &amp;c.

               <p>But now, if neither mockeries, nor miſeries; torments, nor temptations; frownes nor favours will prevaile to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, or affright them from their duty. Then</p>

                  <hi>[They were ſlaine with the Sword;]</hi> Decollation, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heading was then in uſe; and it was cryme enough to be either good, or great; that was the puniſhment of them that remained. Yet others took another courſe: For,</p>

Certainly, it is not onely lawfull to fly in time of Perſecution; but if the fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be Chriſtian, upon ſuch prementioned motives, it will paſſe for a lower kind of Martyrdom; Otherwiſe Chriſt would never have permitted it, much leſſe preſeribed it to his Diſciples. Both Ancient and Moderne Authors have fully writ of this: Among the Antient, <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and <hi>Cypryan:</hi> Of the Moderne, <hi>Abbot</hi> hath Writ a particular Tract.</p>
               <p>By the way, let us before we proceed, pauſe and breath, and from the whole, let us ſee and obſerve the qualities and conditions of wicked men; The ſtate and condition of holy Perſons. The wicked perſecute the godly with dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hatred, and 'its often their lot to fall into the ſnares, and to be under their Rod: Therefore the unworthy world hateth, and that cauſeleſſely too, them of whom the world was not worthy; the Heires of Heaven, Pilgrims on Earth, that's their beſt condition, often it is worſe with them: they are fugitives, deſigned Aſſociates for Saints, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and Chriſt, are preſent companions with Owles and Foxes, in Deſerts and Cavarns; thoſe for whom Chriſt dyed, are in this life <hi>deſtitute, &amp;c.</hi> who have an Eſtate of Glory; have no Portion, nor manſion in the Earth; the Children of Light fly here to diſmall and dark receſſes; and they who have put on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and are cloathed with the Garments of Salvation, are neceſſitated now to be covered with the un-dreſſed Skius of Beaſts; And yet here let us not take a ſuperficiall ſurvey of this their condition, and paſſe a ſuddain cenſure of them, and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:179652:58"/>it; but rather let us remember and conſider what the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſaith and determineth concerning them, and that is high and Honourable, <hi>[Of whom the World was not worthy,]</hi> they are too good to be well thought on, or well uſed, by a had World, though worthy for an unworthy World; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the teſtimoniall and approbation of the all-glorious, and graclous God; the Worlds fugitives, are his favourites; its loathing, Gods love; its ſcorne, Gods delight; whom it brands, God obſerves; whom it condemnes, he honours, and therefore here beſtowes a note of honour worthy of our ſtrict obſervation; <hi>the World was not worthy of them:</hi> The World ſaith, <hi>Away with ſuch fellowes from the Earth, it is not ſit they ſhould live,</hi> Acts 22.22. And that is the conſure of the World, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.9. <hi>For I thinke that God hath ſet forth us the Apoſtles leſt, as it were appointed unto Death. For we are made a ſpectacle unto the World, and to Angele, and to Men.</hi> But God otherwiſe orders the caſe; if they ſuffer, in all their afflictions, he is afflicted; if they Fly, he is preſent with them: <hi>Solus non eſt, cui Chriſtus in fuga Comes: Cyprian lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 6. if they be hence removed, it is to prefer them to Heaven; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were unworthy their company, and the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges might be received thereby, and therefore taken away from them. As thoſe, <hi>who received not the Diſciples,</hi> they were to depart from them as unworthy perſons, leſt they ſhould participate of any comfort or benefit from them, <hi>Marth.</hi> 10.13.14. And as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas turned to the Gentiles,</hi> becauſe the Jewes demeaned themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.46. they were not worthy of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> in the judgement of the Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>The reſult of what hath been thus largely deduced and explained, is to diſcover unto us the ſignall conqueſts of Faith: A <hi>Beleever</hi> is alwayes <hi>Victorious,</hi> whether he Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer by Proweſſe, or by Patience. If Faith teach not his Hand to fight, yet it will teach his Body to ſuffer; it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>acts</hi> wonderfully, or endures nobly: And there is as much gallantry, nay truely more, becauſe greater magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:179652:58"/>in cheerfull undergoing of hardneſſe, then involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary undertaking: For undertakers (and very forward ones too) many times faint and flag, and give over; whereas a ſufferer ſhews his reſolution, and clears all ſuſpition of falſhood, or inconſtancy to his undertaking. Indeed, a true <hi>Beleever</hi> is the ſame in every contingency and ſtate of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faire, and is equally reſolved and diſpoſed, both for proſperity and adverſity; and when moſt <hi>afflicted,</hi> his Faith is moſt glorious, for then it appears in thoſe eminent Graces of humility, meekneſſe, reſignation, &amp;c. which otherwiſe perhaps had been obſcured. And ſo it is of very faithfullneſſe, that God ſuffereth the faithfull to ſuffer, <hi>even that the tryall of their Faith might be much more precious then Gold, though tryed with fire,</hi> 1 Peter 1.7.

But I ſhall onely propoſe to your conſideration <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe, and offer to your obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the ſeries, and contrivances of Providence in <hi>Joſeph,</hi> Reſeue, Sale, Advancement, his after Impriſonment, and againe his high Preferment, and how in every or all of theſe, you may ſee Gods <hi>Juſtice</hi> in <hi>afflicting</hi> his <hi>Wiſedome</hi> in <hi>ordering</hi> thoſe alternative ſorrows and joyes, his mercy in moderating his Brethrens rage, and his griefes; his power removing, and his goodneſſe in rewarding, and even by this uncouth way, providing for the neceſſities, and releife of his Father, and Brethren who ſold him. But now to draw to a concluſion of this ſo long inſiſted on Obſervation; The Apoſtle ſeems here to perſwade theſe <hi>Hebrews to run with patience the race ſet before them, and to take joyfully what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeever ſhall befall them in their way to Heaven,</hi> by an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment taken from their fore-fathers demeanor and behaviour in the like caſe, and Gods gracious dealing with them; which may be reſolved into this, or ſuch like Dilemma; In this your preſent juncture of Affaires, and Perſecution, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your Deliverance is expedient for Gods glory, and your good, or not. If the former be ſuppoſed, and ſo reſolved; or in the affirmative; then certainly, as God in his time, prefixed by his infinite wiſedom, did deliver: and ſave your
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:179652:62"/>Anceſtors; ſo (if the time be come) will he deale with you, even deliver you, though a miracle be required for the effectuating this mercy: For though God uſeth a liberty in the circumſtances of your deliverance, as to the time, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and manner thereof; yet he keeps cloſe and ſure to the ſubſtance of that Rule he hath preſcribed to himſelfe; he will never faile nor forſake them that truſt in him; the patient expectation of the Righteous, ſhall finde what they waite and attend for: He that beleeveth ſhall not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded; He that hopeth ſhall not be aſhamed; that is, bafled in his expectation: If the negative part of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma be conceited, then from the ſame Preſidents, you have theſe encouragements and arguments: There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing happened you, but what hath befalne your holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Gods deareſt Children; He loved them, when he cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſed them; he now chaſtiſeth, and yet loveth you: though the good hand of God did not deliver them; yet the good Spirit of God ſuſtained them, ſo will it you. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. <hi>There hath no temptation taken you, but ſuch as is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to man: But God is faithfull, who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above that you are able: but will with the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, alſo make a way to eſcape, that ye may be able to beare it.</hi> They weited on Gods leiſure, ſo ſhould you, Faith will teach you to doe ſo. In all changes, the moſt changeable, unſetled times, he ſetled and compoſed their ſpirits, though not their ſtates: In all ſorrows, his comforts refreſhed them: In all neceſſities, his preſence ſupported them: In all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, his grace was ſufficient for them; and what he was to them, he will be the ſame to you, (for he changeth nor) if you be to him what they were, faithfull. And now me thinks, the Argument runs not onely <hi>à pari,</hi> but <hi>à fortiori;</hi> not onely in this reſpect, that this Father of mercies hath a more tender and indulgent reſpect for you, then them, having provided better things for you, then for them, as it is in the laſt <hi>Verſe</hi> of this <hi>Chapter;</hi> but alſo upon another account, you have ſtronger motives to a faithfull atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on God, then they; for they had onely Promiſes, and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:179652:63"/>Propheſies to live upon, to nouriſh and cheriſh their Faith; you have not onely what they had, even their Promiſes, and Propheſies; <hi>for they were Written for your Inſtruction,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.11. and they belonged to you as well as to them, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. but you have new Promiſes, and new Propheſies of better things; and which is more, you have the examples and practices of all <hi>Beleovers,</hi> from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the World, till this preſent day; and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Promiſes and Propheſies, you have experiments to ſtrengthen your Faith; and how powerfull examples and experiments are to provoke imitation, eſpecially when the experiments are of the beſt ſort, and the examples drawn from them, whoſe memory we moſt honour, as of our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, a ſhort digreſſion will eaſily demonſtrate. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examples are Rhetoricall Sillogiſmes, have a ſtrong per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſive Power both with men of great judgement, and weaker parts, for they inſinuate (eſpecially if they jumpe with mens inelinations) more eaſily, and purchaſe more kindly mens affections, then down right reaſon, argument, or demonſtration, and are hereby a Topicke more apt to gain imitation, then precepts backt with the moſt cogent reaſon, to procure obedience. For the obligingneſſe of a bare Precept, is either from the authority of the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, (and men are naturally rebells, <hi>uitimur in vetitum</hi>) or the reaſonableneſſe of the duty; and 'its the hardeſt thing to effect (conſidering how men are inclined to be drawn by ſenſuall <hi>objects,</hi> and led by cuſtomes) that reaſonable men ſhould be in their duty rationall; or from the aſſurance of reward; and how dull men are to apprehend and beleeve future good things, and to live by hope; every one ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Let me have it in my hand, and ſo make ſure work, is frequently experimented; and ſo this very conſideration is an abatement to the power of Precept. But Examples makes all theſe <hi>reſpects</hi> and obligations good; for if the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand run thus, <hi>Doe this,</hi> not becauſe it is commanded; but becauſe this is the <hi>practiſe</hi> of the wiſeſt, and the beſt, or the moſt honourable, they have done ſo before you, and

And to come yet ſomewhat more home; as theſe <hi>Hebrews</hi> had the <hi>practiſe</hi> and <hi>experience</hi> of the former Ages, to eſtabliſh their Faith; ſo have we, and more too; and therefore greater reaſon have we not to be moved at the ſufferings of Chriſtians, nor to be aſhamed of Chriſt Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, and to performe our whole Baptiſmall Covenant, in as much as we have the advantage of what <hi>examples</hi> they had: and beſides, the Patternes of the Apoſtles, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall men, famous in their Generations: We have the <hi>Acts,</hi> or rather (upon peruſall of that Book) <hi>the ſufferings of the Apoſtles;</hi> and we have Tradition all along, handing out to us the Chriſtian <hi>Acts</hi> and ſufferings of Confeſſors, Martyrs, and ſeverall Religious People ever ſince, for the ſpace of 1600. years, and all atteſted by Hiſtorians of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted fidelity, eſpecially thoſe of the <hi>firſt ſix Centuries.</hi> Hence ſet dayes were cuſtomarily, and by Order Appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the ſolemne Celebration of the <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>ſufferings of thoſe Primitive Saints</hi> in the Chriſtian Church, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:179652:65"/>and ſome Apoſtolicall (as I ſaid) Perſons, not ſo much for their honour, (certainly not for religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of them by Invocation, Oblations, &amp;c.) but for our Imitation, and to bleſſe God for ſuch Inſtruments of his glory, and our good. For that their ſufferings were for this end, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> is <hi>expreſſe;</hi> The ſuffering of an eminent principall member, redounds to the good of the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, (<hi>Col.</hi> 1.24.) tends to its edification, and confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.12. For although Chriſt propoſed himſelfe to us for the grand Exemplar, <hi>Learne of me, And follow me;</hi> yet we could no otherwiſe follow Chriſt, but as the Boy <hi>Aſcanius</hi> followed his Father, <hi>Non-paſſibus equis,</hi> by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>even motion we cannot follow him regularly, but we trip, and ſtumble, and often fall, (for he could not ſin) and it is he muſt lift us up. And as his Example is too high; ſo his leſſon is too hard, we cannot tranſcribe the Copy, but with blurring and crooking in and out; nay, we ſhall be ſo far ſhort, that we ſhall doe nothing like, unleſſe he leade us by the hand; and even then, our hand may be eaſily known by its foulneſſe, as when he takes not by the hand to hold, we fall, the errors of our feet may be eaſily marked; and ſo, though Chriſt be a more high and ſure, being an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Patterne for imitation then any, or all other holy men amaſſed together; yet the Examples of theſe who were ſubject to the like paſſions as we, are more ſuitable for our conviction, and condition, becauſe we cannot doe, or ſuffer as Chriſt did, neither for the manner or meaſure; <hi>For in him all fulneſſe dwels: And the Spirit was given to him without meaſure,</hi> John 3.34. but we may doe and ſuffer as holy men did before us; for to them as well as to us, and to us as well as to them, the Spirit is given by meaſure; and God accepts according to what a man bath, and not what he hath not. And hereupon this practiſe hath been obſerved, to commemorate the holy Saints, in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture eſpecially, (for they are infallibly ſuch) as a duty of that part of the Communion of Saints, as an help by their Example for our inſtruction, and conſolation. Thus much
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:179652:66"/>by the way, and the digreſſion hath been long, and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; yet becauſe as Travellers ſometimes goe out of the was to fetch in Proviſion for their ſupplies, and comfort; and this courſe, though it retard the way, yet makes it pleaſant, eſpecially to thoſe who have long Stages: So be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this digreſſion may be both delightfull, and profitable, I have inſiſted the longer, and brought in ſome additionall ſupplies for a further refreſhment. But now to returne; The way of God in the diſpenſation of temporalls, ſo far at is diſcoverable, is various; ſometimes he takes one way, ſometimes another, as is evident in the precedent Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents: <hi>Paſcimur hic, &amp; patimur:</hi> God ſometimes cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and favoureth his Children; ſometimes he frownes on them, corrects, and chaſtens them, and that by ſharpe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes; ſometimes he ſuffers his little Flock to wander, and to walk through the Valley of the ſhadow of Death; ſometimes again he gathers them he feeds them in a green Paſture, and leads them forth beſides the Waters of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Chriſtianity is compared to a warſare, and that is not a condition of eaſe, but of trouble, hardneſſe, and hazard; and ſo a Chriſtian muſt have his Armour, <hi>even the whole Armour of God;</hi> and he muſt endure hardneſſe, as a good Souldier of Jeſus Chriſt. The Church of God is compared to a Ship, which though ſomtimes ſhe goe ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and calmly; yet, for the moſt part, ſhe is unquiet, as the Element ſhe moves upon; and many times ſhe is toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed too and fro with ſtrong guſts and tempeſts, and either by the violence of the Wind, and the ſierceneſſe of the ſurging Seat, in danger to ſinke, or to ground on Sands, or ſplit on Rocks, or ſpring a leake, and ſo be ſwallowed and devoured: and the Diſciples of Chriſt are the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Paſſengers in this Ship; and ſometimes in theſe great tempeſts, Chriſt the Maſter ſleepeth, till the Diſciples by Prayer awake him, and then he ariſeth, <hi>and rebaketh the Wind, and the Sea, and there is a great calme.</hi> Saint <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> compares the life of a Chriſtian to a Webb ſo mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velouſly woven and made up of trouble and comfort, that
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:179652:66"/>though the longer threads reaching from our Birth to our Death, be all of trouble; yet the weft interjected is all of comfort. So that from hence it is apparent. That theſe their troubles and ſufferings are not the <hi>effects</hi> of Gods vindicative juſtice, acts of revenge, and ſo properly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, (as a croſſe or dangerous paſſage by Sea, is not an Exile to a Mariner, (though it be to a Malefactor that flyes that way,) but it is in his Calling and Trade, a Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique and Taske,) but <hi>effects</hi> of love, <hi>acts</hi> of Diſcipline; For, <hi>Poena in ſuo formali denotat quid intrinſeco malum:</hi> Every Puniſhment is truely from a Sentence of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; <hi>And there is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Rom. 8.1. <hi>And we are judged by the Lord, that we ſhould not be condemned with the World,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.32.

And who will not adventure, and endure for a Crowne, eſpecially when they have ſecurity, that for the adventure, and a little ſufferings, they may obtaine; and having obtained it, for ever enjoy it in a moſt peaceable poſſeſſion?

And as this conſideration affords plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full matter to the righteous Patient of inſtruction and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; <hi>Non ſi male nunc, &amp; olim ſic erit;</hi> ſo it yeild: great occaſion of terrour to the thriving triumphing impenitent, who is reſerved onely (and fatted) for the day of ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: For upon this ſuppoſition, <hi>That judgement begins at the Houſe of God,</hi> the Apoſtle draws that to them ſad, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall, and terrible influence; <hi>What ſhall the end be of them that obey not the Goſpel?</hi> 1 Peter 4.17.18. a judgement ſo fearfull, and terrible, that he ſeems afraid clearly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe; and yet by that Interrogation, gives ſufficient no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it: for this Interrogation is the ſame in effect with that Poſition of another Apoſtle, <hi>Vengeaxce is mixe (ſaith the Lord) I will repay.

               <p>You ſee then here how forcible and prevalent examples, eſpecially of thoſe we honour, or ought to honour; and that not onely of Chriſt himſelf, whoſe example ought not onely to be an Argument to perſwade, which force other examples of holy men hath; but it is a certain rule to direct, which power the others abſolutely, and abſtractedly hath not, <hi>John</hi> 13.4. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.6. Hence that of <hi>Bernard; Quid vobis cum virtutibus, qui virtutem Chriſti ignoratis? ubi num quaeſo verae prudentiae, niſi in Chriſti Doctrina? ubi vera temperantia, niſi in Chriſti vita? ubi vera fortitude, niſi in paſſione?</hi> that is, What have you to doe with ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous converſation, who know not the vertues of Chriſt? For where, I pray you, can true wiſedom and knowledge be found, but in the Doctrine of Chriſt? Where true tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance and moderation, but in the life of Chriſt? True valour and magnanimity, but in the Paſſion and Death of Chriſt? His Life and Death was not onely an Example, but a Directory to us, how to live godly, and juſtly, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, as the former ſort of theſe <hi>[others]</hi> here prementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this praeciſion; and how to die honourably, and to ſuffer patiently, as the ſecond ſort of theſe <hi>[others]</hi> did. Let the Life then, and Death of Chriſt be our Rule to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:179652:68"/>direct us in every eſtate and condition; and let Chriſts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and the examples alſo of others, be as arguments and enducerments to encline and move us more forcibly and effectually to follow his directions and rules of holy living and dying: and let us alſo be exemplary in our lives and converſations, and by our exemplary living, adorne the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, provoking one another unto good works, that even others ſeeing our good works, may glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie God in the day of viſitation; that we be not onely burning lights, having zeale within; but ſhining alſo, holding forth our light to others: Eſpecially this concerns Magiſtrates, who have a civill relation to their inſeriours; To Paſtors, who have a ſpirituall affinity with, and neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to their Flock: And Parents, who have a naturall tie to their Children; our eivill, ſpirituall, and naturall Fathers, as they are to be reſpectively honoured; ſo they are to walk as worthy of honour; And not onely in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their own welfare, but to the good of thoſe under their charge whereunto they powerfully adminiſter by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary Piety. Chriſt hath afforded himſelfe and others examples to us, that we for him, to his glory, and to others for their good, might likewiſe be examples. It was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent expreſſion of <hi>Fulgentius</hi> in his <hi>African</hi> ſtile, which he uſeth to ſhew the power of examples in Superiours; <hi>Converſio potentium, multùm militat acquiſitionibus Chriſti;</hi> that is, The converſion of men in Authority (and ſuch are all thoſe ſeverall capacities) fights powerfully for the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions of Chriſt, or it purchaſeth much to Chriſt; for ſuch as theſe (ſaith he, it is in the 6. <hi>Ep. de Con. ad Theed.</hi>) either ruine many with themſelves, or elſe ſave; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore either great puniſhments attend them, if they prove, <hi>Male imitationis laqueum;</hi> Inſtruments of evill example; or elſe great Glory, if they be eminent in holy converſation: For ſo he goes on, applying this to that particular caſe he ſpeaks on, and holds a perfect Analogy in the other; <hi>Quis non parvum, &amp;c.</hi> Who will not deſpiſe and neglect his poor Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, when he ſeeth a Senatour neglecting his ſtately and

And now, that the Example of <hi>theſe others,</hi> and many ſince may draw us to an imitation of their Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Vertues; and that we may be exemplary to others to provoke them, let us addreſſe our ſelves to the great exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar for grace and ſtrength, both to leade others who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or equall to us, and follow Chriſt and others who have gone before us: For, <hi>Hac itur ad ſuperos;</hi> this is the way, walk in it, even the way to him who is the way, the truth, and life.

               <p>But from hence (to return) we may obſerve where the ſtrength of an Induction lyes, not in ſome ſingle ſeattered, or diſperſed prooſes, or inſtances; but in a full body of them uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together, eſpecially if an Induction be made uſe of in the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:179652:71"/>concerns of Religion, and Religious Truths and Obſervances. For in this caſe, thoſe Truths and Obſervances are not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently atteſted, nor convincingly propoſed, which have onely the determination and approbation, the good report of ſome one or more particular Churches; becauſe a Church of any one denomination is fallible, hath no aſſurance that ſhe may not ſayle, or that the Candle ſtick ſhould not be removed from her; no Nationall Church hath a Promiſe for a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall exiſtence; that is, though a Pure, Holy, Orthodoxe, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique, and Apoſtolicall Church at this time, ſhould conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue ſo unto all ſucceſſions and Ages, in the ſame purity and perfections. As for inſtance, we may not conclude this obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to be a Catholique obſervation, or an obſervation of Faith, becauſe the Roman Church practiſeth, and under curſe, or <hi>Anathema,</hi> exacts or impoſeth the obſervation thereof. For though ſome of her obſervations and determinations in that kind may be truely Cotholique; yet we are not ſo to eſteem them barely upon her report; but becauſe ſhe holds them <hi>in communi</hi> with the Catholique Church. For that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> and <hi>Catholique</hi> are convertible, we are not bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, becauſe the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> beleeve ſo, and give us their word for it; we may lawfully demand their proofes, and till theſe he convincingly and cogently produced, we may lawfully leave them to the poor fallacy of <hi>begging the Queſtion.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may we reſolve this Tenet of the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> is <hi>de fide,</hi> an Article of the Chriſtian Faith, becauſe they hold and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, and obtrudes the beleefe thereof under the ſentence of Excommunication; both becauſe they are not the onely Catholiques, that is, aſſertors of the Catholique Faith; their Church is not the <hi>Catholique Church,</hi> but of a confined, limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Communion and Iuriſdiction. And for them to pretend, and aſſume their Church to be the Catholique, without proofe, is ſtill <hi>to beg the Queſtion;</hi> and becauſe every particular, and ſo that Church may erre, and <hi>de facte,</hi> hath erred, as well in her Tenets as Obſervations, and departed from <hi>Catholique</hi> Verities, as well as Practiſes. But now, if the Tenet be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated to a Tenet of the <hi>Catholique Church</hi> truely ſo
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:179652:71"/>called; that is, <hi>[all theſe]</hi> the people of God, beleevers of all Ages have thus taught and beleeved, taught and practiſed; this demonſtration engages and commands our perſwaſion, and obedience. For it is not imaginable, that <hi>[all theſe]</hi> being qualified as the <hi>[all theſe]</hi> here in theſe words, (conſtant practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers and faithfull ſufferers for their beleife and practiſes,) ſhould combine and conſpire unanimouſly to deſtroy themſelves, and deceive others; both becauſe we ſuppoſe them holy men, and alſo men of admirable parts, of great ſtrength, and clearneſſe of underſtanding: And as their holineſſe preſerved them from worldly deſignes, and contrivances in their profeſſion, witneſſe that high eſteem they had thereof, as even to ſuffer death for it; ſo their wiſedome and learning kept them from groſſe overſights of miſunderſtanding and prejudice in theſe things they both profeſſed and ſuffered; which was the diſeipline of the holy Jeſus, who could and would highly and honourably crowne their ſufferings. And hence it will undeniably fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>[theſe all]</hi> Primitive Fathers and Chriſtians, (which is a very wonderfull thing) notwithſtanding their ſeverall tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and inclinations, their ſeverall Ages and Succeſſions, their ſeverall diſtances and Countries, yet did agree for the ſpace of fifteen hundred years, conſtantly and unanimouſly in all thoſe things, which were revealed and recommended by our Saviour <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as important and neceſſary to ſalvation: (for if they were ignorant of any Article neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, how could they be ſaved?) it follows (I ſay) by their ſuch agreement, and conſent, That this is an Article of the Chriſtian Diſcipline in what they held and obſerved, is a ſtrong and ſolid proofe to all godly ſober men, That Tenet ſo held, is a Catholique Tenet; and that Obſervation ſo uſed, is a Catholique Obſervation; and to oppoſe, or contradict either, is Hereſie and Schiſme; or which is all one, an Hereticall, or Schiſmaticall ſeparation and departure, from the true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Catholique Faith. Adde to all this, That the differences in Opinions, and diſagreements among themſelves in many Points of Religion, which are not <hi>de ſymbolo,</hi> of neceſſary beleiſe; but truths onely of an inferiour natute, will to any
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:179652:72"/>indifferent, unbiaſſed Perſons, take off, and clearly acquit their conſent and agreement in the maine Fundamentalls, the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ms Fundamentalia</hi> from all ſuſpition, that it proceeded from ſome combination, correſpondence, or mutuall intelligence, and common couſultation; and withall, fully ſatisfie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, that it proceeded out of a ſerious examination, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the things themſelves. And then ſecondly, as the concurrence of <hi>theſe all,</hi> is a valid Teſtimony in neceſſary points; ſo in theſe points and means of ſalvation, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſilence of the Ancients <hi>[theſe all]</hi> would be a very proper and unanſwerable Argument to prove the nullity or falſeneſſe of it, as this Doctrine was not known or beleeved in the pareſt and Primitive times: therefore it is not an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Faith, a Catholique verity; but a Novelty, or upſtare Opinion. As for Example, If we find nothing either in whole or in part, either in groſſe, or in retaile, concerning the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchicall Authority of the Pope, or the ſupream Authority of the preſent <hi>Roman Church,</hi> or concerning Purgatory and Tranſubſtantiation, among the Writings of the Fathers, and Records of the Antient Church; we may ſafely conclude, they are not ſuch as they pretend them to be neceſſary, ſuch where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our ſalvation dependeth; for if they be ſuch, as they would have us beleeve; it would be too great injuſtice to the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, to ſay, They knew nothing of them; or that knowing them, they would not ſpeak any word of them, and diſcharge their truſt. And laſtly, it hence alſo follows, That in thoſe unhappy controverſies which are continued in this Nationall Church, it is not faire and ingenuous dealing in ſome of thoſe Diſputants, to aver and avow the practiſe and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſome reformed <hi>Churches</hi> in the laſt <hi>Contury,</hi> or hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; when others put in their Plea from the conſent and practiſe of the former fifteen <hi>Centuries:</hi> For what is this, but to oppoſe a part againſt the whole? a part in one <hi>Centurie,</hi> againſt it ſelfe, and all other <hi>Churches,</hi> for fifteen? a few againſt <hi>[all theſe.]</hi> But above all, they are groſſely abſurd, who to <hi>[theſe all]</hi> have none to oppoſe but themſelves; have no Authority, but their power; no reaſon, but their
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:179652:72"/>fancy; no Teſtimony, but their own approbation; and they themſelves ſo inconſiderable, in <hi>reſpect</hi> of <hi>[theſe all,]</hi> that they are not ſo much as the Gleanings of a full Corne Feild in a large <hi>Campania</hi> to the whole <hi>Cropp.</hi> And yet they deale ſubtilly too; for they take a ſafe courſe, that they ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſatisfie you; nor you confute them: For their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Evidence, is, their Conſcience; and what that is, you cannot, they will not know. And hence they are ſuch Vagrants in their Faith, you ſhall never know where to have them; and ſo they may juſtly be excluded out of the Catalogue of <hi>[theſe all,]</hi> and be in the pack of Saint <hi>Judes</hi> Bruites; <hi>They ſpeak evill of thoſe things they know not; and corrupt themſelves in thoſe things they know naturally,</hi> Jude 10. And yet there is a third ſort, who though not ſo bad as theſe, yet bad enough, diſparaging, and decrying the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of <hi>[theſe all]</hi> in the <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> fleighting, and undervaluing their Authority, and Writings, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting them as uſeleſſe; except the Apoſtles themſelves, and their Writings. The vanity of this miſpriſion will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently appear; if we remember, That the whole diſpute is, what is Apoſtolicall, or not; what they practiſed, or not: And then the reſult is obvious; Thoſe Perſons who lived in, or immediately after the Apoſtles times, ſhould know better their uſage, then we, at this diſtance of time can gueſſe at; they who ſearched into all Records, to diſcover what was Apoſtolicall, and were after carefull to keep them, ſhould know better, then they who care for no Evidences, Teſtimonies, or Records; and all this upon no other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, but this; That the miſtery of iniquity then wrought, and ſince, notorious forgery hath been uſed to corrupt all Teſtimonies and Books; the former of which is moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, becauſe even then, though corruptions and Haereſies crept in; yet were they zealouſly oppoſed, and punctually confuted by the Writers of thoſe Times. The latter is partly falſe, altogether impertinent: For the ſame Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction might be uſed againſt the Canonicall Books of holy Scripture, if in the inſtance it be admitted good; and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:179652:73"/>againſt all Records of Kingdoms and Common-wealths, that from them, it were impoſſible to find out what the former Laws and Cuſtomes have been; for in all theſe, there may equally be ſuſpition of Fraud and Forgery, as in the other kind: And yet, no wiſe man, becauſe the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very is ſomewhat intricate and perplext, and the buſineſſe a work of difficulty, will therefore conclude it altogether uſeleſſe, and to no purpoſe. Certainly, they who labour for the finding out the truth by the ſearch of Antiquity, next after holy Scripture, are more likely to diſcover it by that way, then any other. As they, who would know our Laws and Cuſtoms, are more probable to find them out by ſearching the Antient Records, and Law Writers, then by conſulting preſent Authors; unleſſe we take all upon truſt, and at the ſecond hand. But now, to prevent mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes, it may be worthy our enquiry, to examine what proofes are Catholique, or not: Or how we may know, whether this Doctrine, or Obſervation be truely Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, ſuch as <hi>[theſe all]</hi> have acknowledged, and wherein this Univerſality conſiſts: And the rather, becauſe it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, both by the Romaniſts, and Reformed, That that <hi>Church</hi> which can evidence it to hold that Faith once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the Saints, without Haereticall Innovation, or Schiſmaticall Violation, is undoubtedly the true <hi>Church</hi> of God. And it is further acknowledged by the Reformed, <hi>De meliori notae,</hi> of the beſt Ranke, That the Title <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique</hi> doth moſt properly and fitly expreſſe, whether Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, or Chriſtian Societies, which hold the common Faith without particular diviſions from the maine body of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, in oppoſition to all Heretikes and Schiſmaticks; But ſince the <hi>Church</hi> is divided, and rent by Hereſie and Schiſme; To whom ſhould this Title be rightly appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated? or who can be truely called <hi>Catholique,</hi> but they who agree and joyne with <hi>[theſe all,]</hi> Apoſtles, Fathers, Martyrs, (for what the Patriarkes, and the reſt were to the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> the Apoſtles, and their Succeſſors, are the ſame to us) Beleevers, the maine Body of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi>

And again, the <hi>Reformed Engliſh Church</hi> cannot be guilty of <hi>Schiſme,</hi> becauſe ſhe holds Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the whole Church in all her ancient Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Catholike uſages and cuſtomes, and diſclaims all which are not ſo, as to her practiſe; but condemns not, nor cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures any other particular Church, further then by Apologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing and defending her ſelfe, to be truely Apoſtolicall: and if herein ſhe be wanting to her ſelfe; yet ſhe can produce the Teſtimony, and good report for her Apoſtolicalneſſe, of the beſt Reformed Churches, and indeed, the Univerſall Church of this Age. But I have extended this digreſſion further then I intended, or may be adjudged by others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient and pertinent: But ſure I am, not ſo far as the weight and importance of the ſubject doth deſerve; for in ſuch ſubjects there ſhould not be <hi>à nonnulla deſiderantur,</hi> ſomewhat more expected; and yet here much more might be added.</p>

               <p>But becauſe one Reſolution will ſatisfie all theſe Demands, and Interrogatories; And the clearing any one of the three, will be the deciſion, and finall determination of the reſt: Therefore I ſhall return onely one Anſwer to the Quaeries; yet in order thereunto, I ſhall give you the ſeverall conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures and judgements, which I find in this inſtance; declare what I conceive moſt rationall and ſatisfactory, allowing to others the ſame liberty, which I challenge to my ſelfe, to take what they like beſt, or ought to doe, according to the Rules of Art and Religion: And there are foure ſeverall Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in this Point.</p>
               <p>The firſt, and in my conceit, the worſt, as being meerly conjecturall, and phantaſticall, is the received interpretation, and common Tenet of the preſent <hi>Romiſh Doctors,</hi> who affirme, <hi>That theſe received not the promiſe, becauſe immediately after death, they were not received into Heaven:</hi> But (as they fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy) <hi>the ſeparated foules of theſe faithfull ones, departed into a ſubterraneous place, bordering upon the confines of Hell, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the upper, or higher Region of Hell, which they call,</hi> Limbus Patrum, <hi>where they were in durance, and detained Priſoners, untill Chriſts Aſcention into Heaven; whereupon having received their</hi> liberato <hi>and diſmiſſion, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and admitted into the Seat of Glory.</hi> Whereas Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers under the Goſpel, have an higher Priviledge thereby, even to paſſe immediately after their departure into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</p>
               <p>This is their Reſolution; But in truth, what meaſures or degrees of felicity <hi>[theſe all]</hi> received by Chriſts Aſcention; or what immunities or liberties, is not the poſtulate, or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of inquiry here; For it will be granted, that they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved larger favours, then before were indulged to, or allowed them; and that thereby their joyes and felicities were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed and multiplyed. For if the Angels themſelves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by Chriſts comming into the World an addition and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:179652:79"/>augmentation of light and knowledge (and ſo conſequently of glory and happineſſe, as the Apoſtle very poſitively aſſirmes they did, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.10. <hi>that new, &amp;c.</hi> then we need not ſcruple to give to the Soules of Beleevers ſome accidentall meaſures and increments of felicity thereby; neither can it be any prejudice to the Faith, to acknowledge, that God would, and did perfect their beatitudes and bliſſe at divers times, and in different degrees, (for their bliſſe was not completed, <hi>ſimul &amp; ſemel,</hi> altogether, and at once,) and that the moſt eminent, principall, and nobleſt perfection was reſerved for this great ſolemnity of Chriſts Reſurrection and Aſcention: And yet further, it may be granted as very probable, that the degrees of future happineſſe ſhall be proportioned to the meaſures and degrees of Grace and Revelation which God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively, and in ſeverall ſucceſſions imparted to his Church. And if ſo, then it will follow, That as confeſſedly God hath exhibited greater abundance of Revelation and Grace unto the <hi>Beleevers</hi> under the Goſpel, then to thoſe under the Law; ſo thoſe ſhall be partakers of higher Formes or Sears of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, then <hi>[theſe all]</hi> could. Neither doe theſe liberall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions any whit advantage the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> perſwaſion or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, becauſe they no way conclude or infer their Poſition; for they peremptorily exclude the Soules of <hi>[theſe all]</hi> from Heaven; and not onely ſo, but keep them under reſtraint, confine, &amp; ſhut them up in under ground, Vaults, and Cells, not far from Hell. And this Poſition we reject, as contrary to an Old Teſtament Revelation, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12.7. <hi>the ſpirit returns unto God who gove it:</hi> Which words of the Wiſe Man, though they doe not <hi>in terminis terminantibus,</hi> expreſſe Language determine whether their Soules return to God mediately or immediately upon their ſeparation; yet the context makes the meaning plain, and the Text a clear proof of their imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate return; for as the duſt, immediately after the departure of the Soule, returns to what it was; even ſo the Soule after its divorce from the Body, returns immediately to its Creator. And this is alſo agreeable to Gods juſt and gracious dealings with his choſen in all Generations; to reward the work of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:179652:79"/>Faith, labour of love, patience of hope; to order and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point to Travellers, when at their Journyes end, their reſting place; To Runners, when their Courſe is finiſhed, the Prize; To Crown his Souldiers, <hi>who have fought the good fight of Faith,</hi> with Glory; To receive his Servants, when they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed their duty, and done their work, into his preſence, and to enter them into their Maſters joyes; ſettle and poſſeſſe his Children of their Inheritance; which reſting Place Prize, Crown of Glory, Glorious Preſence, Joyes, and Inheritance, hath been purchaſed and bought, and ſo demiſed and granted to the <hi>[theſe all]</hi> in this place, as well as to the ſucceeding Generations. For although then Chriſt had not <hi>actually ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> and ſo they not <hi>actually ranſomed;</hi> yet even then <hi>(he being the Lambe ſlain before the Foundation of the World)</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally, or in the Eye of the Law, or rather of the juſt Judge and Soveraigne Lord, he did ſuffer, and they were <hi>Redeemed;</hi> inaſmuch as God had <hi>Decreed,</hi> that ſatisfaction made on the Croſſe to his juſtice, ſhould be as available to them, as to us: and the merits of Chriſts death as imputable to them, as to us; And upon that account God accepted <hi>[theſe all]</hi> as his <hi>Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ones;</hi> Even as an honeſt Creditor will releaſe his Debtor, when a faithfull Solvent, Surety, or undertaker makes ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, or gives ſecurity to content, and according to deſire and demand. And as <hi>Jeſus Chriſt was yeſterday, and to day, and for ever,</hi> Heb. 13. ſo the vertue of his death, is Eternall, both <hi>à parte ante,</hi> and <hi>à parte poſt,</hi> is from, and to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. But beſides all this premiſed, we have expreſſe Evidence for our Plea and Cauſe; for the <hi>precedent Verſes</hi> of this <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> where it is ſet down in plain Language, that ſome of <hi>[theſe all] had paſſed from Earth to Heaven;</hi> and particularly inſtanced in <hi>Enoch,</hi> and <hi>Elijah;</hi> and its ſaid of <hi>Abraham, that he looked for a City;</hi> and that ſure, was a free Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Place, conſpicuous, eminent, and glorious; not a cloſe dark hole or Priſon; and of the <hi>Patriarkes,</hi> that they aymed at, <hi>Patriam Caeleſtem,</hi> an Heavenly Country; and that <hi>jam tum illis paratum,</hi> even then prepared for them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.10.16. And hereupon <hi>Haymo</hi> thus concludes, <hi>Nunc verò quieſcunt in animae, in heatudine Regui Caeleſtis, ineffabili lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titia
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:179652:80"/>perfruontes:</hi> It ſeems this conceit of the preſent <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcs,</hi> was not at that time a <hi>Catholike truth;</hi> or elſe he was miſtaken.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is that of ſome of the Ancient Fathers, who referr this <hi>common perfection</hi> to be received, ſolely to the day of the <hi>Reſurrection;</hi> ſuppoſing, That no Soules enter into Heaven, or enjoyes the beatificall Viſion, till the day of the generall Reſurrection. But although the ſouls be extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the time of their ſeparation from the Body; yet they did lye in ſeeret receptacles, in a profound, or deep ſleep, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> doing nothing, ſuffering nothing in the mean time, but onely the delay of their Glory. For ſo ſome of them conceive, <hi>That Heaven ſhall not be opened till the day of Judgement, unleſſe to a few priviledged perſons.</hi> And of this opinion was <hi>Irenous, Iuſt. Martyr, Tertull. Auguſt. Ambroſe, Iohn:</hi> 22. and the <hi>Greeke Church</hi> ſtill maintains it. The Text upon which they ground this perſwaſion, is, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 6.9.10.11. <hi>I ſaw under the Altar the ſoules of them that wore ſlain for the Word of God, &amp;c.</hi> Indeed there are ſeverall Expoſitions of this place; Some making it Allegoricall: Others Figurative, &amp;c. Whatſoever the true meaning is; Certainly the Text ſtrongly proves the Immortality of the humane Soules, by their ſubſiſtence after ſeparated: But whether their Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, let others judge. Indeed ſome later Divines, have mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated the ſuppoſition; Neither with the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> dooming their ſoules to inferior Vaults, if not infernall: Nor placing in ſeverall reſting receptacles; yet withall, allowing them no reſidence in Heaven, the Throne of Gods Glory. But they pretend, they are carried into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome; or (which is all one with them) to Paradiſe; thus diſtinguiſhing Paradiſe from Heaven; which diſtinction they attempt to prove from theſe following places of holy Scripture. Firſt, from <hi>Luke</hi> 23.43. <hi>To day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe:</hi> From which words, they thus argue, (how concludingly, let others examine,) That Paradiſe muſt needs import a Place or Seate of bleſſedneſſe, becauſe it is promiſed, as a mercifull reward and favour; and this reward, the enjoyment of the ſociety of Ieſus; yet Heaven it cannot be, becauſe that Kingdom of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:179652:80"/>bliſſe was not opened, till Chriſt made the firſt entry, and took Poſſeſſion thereof at his Aſcenſion, when he was ſolemnly inau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurated intoch is Kingly Office: And ſo they Expound Chriſts deſcent into Hell, to ſignifie a ſtate of ſeparation, or common receptable of Spirits; ſo that with them, both are Seats of Glory; but the one far excelling the other. And this they in the ſecond place ſtrengthen from, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. ſuppoſing Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had two Revelations; One, <hi>When he was caught up into the, third Heaven:</hi> The other, <hi>When into Paradiſe;</hi> which, (ſay they) was the place from whence <hi>Laezarus</hi> his ſoule was called back: But that the chief and higheſt degree of bliſſe, is reſerved for the laſt day, they infer from <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.43. and 25.34 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. But the now common received opinion (which is all I adde by way of cenſure) is, That all the ſoules of the ſaints departed, goe ſtraightwayes to Heaven upon their ſeparation. To this purpoſe, compare <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22.23.24. which words ſeem to have this ſenſe; The ſpirits of the juſt could not be perfect, unleſſe they were in Heaven, enjoying the ſociety of God, Chriſt, and the Angels; and by enjoyment of theſe, their being in Heaven is concluded. So 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. <hi>If our Earthly Tabernacle, &amp;c.</hi> then <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, we have immediately thereupon, <hi>a building of God, &amp;c.</hi> as ſoon as the Tabernacle is diſſolved: Otherwiſe, the Apoſtle would not have ſaid, <hi>[we have]</hi> but, we hope, or expect; and to expect, is but in reference to a reverſion; <hi>to have,</hi> ſuppoſes Poſſeſſion: For here, we hope for Heaven, we have it not; and here we deſire we may have. For ſo it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>ver,</hi> 2. <hi>In this we groane, &amp;c. Yet we would not have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to be uncloathed,</hi> ver. 4. but upon this account and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, That as ſoon as we were uncloathed, we would be cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, that mortality might be ſwallowed up of life. And further yet, <hi>We are willing to be abſent from the Body, that we might be preſent with the Lord,</hi> ver. 8. of the ſame Chapter. Hence St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. <hi>I deſire to depart, and to be with Chriſt.</hi> And St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> when he dyed, thus Prayed; <hi>Lord Ieſus receive my ſpirit,</hi> Acts 7.59. and he Prayed ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he beleeved (for this was a Prayer of Faith) <hi>Ieſus would
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:179652:81"/>receive his Spirit.</hi> But <hi>ſuper totam materiam,</hi> we ſhall anon find, as hath been proved, and ſhall be further, that waving the ſuppoſition upon which this ſecond judgement is given, it yet comes neer the mark, and the truth, if it be not the truth it ſelfe. And therefore we paſſe to the third.</p>
               <p>The third is that, which is commonly aſſerted by moſt of the Writers of the Reformed Churches, who apprehend this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to relate to Chriſts Incarnation; and with theſe, the words are thus Paraphraſed <hi>[they obtained not the promiſes]</hi> that is, The promiſed Meſſas had not in their times aſſumed the humane nature, and become fleſh: So <hi>Beza, Non obtinue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt,</hi> they obtained not; that is, <hi>Eminus viderunt Chriſtum,</hi> they looked for Chriſt to come; they ſaw him, as <hi>Abraham</hi> afar off: So <hi>Major, Non ſunt conſecuti promiſſionem,</hi> viz. <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſum ſemen mulieris;</hi> the promiſed Seed of the Woman: And ſo <hi>Calvin, Iunius, Piſcator;</hi> and certainly, their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment herein is true; the diſpenſation under Chriſt, more glorious, then that under the Law, and greater perfections re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and better proviſion made by Chriſts comming, then was before; inſomuch, that our Saviour affirmeth the Diſciples bleſſed, <hi>Becauſe their Eyes ſaw, &amp;c.</hi> Luke 10.23.24. And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tells us; <hi>God manifeſt in the fleſh, is the great Myſtery of godlineſſe,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.16. Yet (under ſubmiſſion to greater judgements) I conceive this not ſo full, and home, as to give deſired ſatisfaction to a punctuall examiner, nor ſo pertinent to the Apoſtles Text; for though Chriſt, who <hi>was perfected here himſelf,</hi> Heb. 7.28. <hi>and did perfect for ever them that are ſanctified,</hi> Heb. 10.14. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11.12. <hi>did come to perfect what ſtood need thereof.</hi> Yet ſomewhat more then Chriſts Incarnation is required to our perfection; and our perfection did not ſolely, not properly conſiſt in Chriſts comming; but by thoſe acts and ſufferings he was fitted and prepared for by aſſuming our fleſh. And now we will conſider the fourth.</p>
               <p>The fourth is that of St. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> and ſome Ancients; and followed alſo by ſome later Expoſitors; <hi>They obtained not the promiſes;</hi> that is, the Reſurrection of the fleſh: And ſo this falls in this reſpect with the ſecond; the onely difference
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:179652:81"/>being this, That the ſecond, ſuppoſed not the ſeparated ſoules to be in Heaven; this ſuppoſes them in Heaven: but to receive the complement of bliſſe, at the day of the Reſurrection of all fleſh, which is the perfection of the whole Church, &amp; every particular member; who as before, at the day of their death, had a private pardon; ſo at that day ſhall further obtain a publique promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, whoſe ſoules though they be in a condition of bleſſedneſſe; yet, till then, they want their <hi>Conſummatum eſt,</hi> the conſummation of this bleſſedneſſe, both <hi>extenſivè,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their intire ſtate, the body not till then, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united to the ſoule; and probably, <hi>intenſivè</hi> too, in reſpect of meaſures and degrees of bliſſe, the ſoule not till then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo cleare a Viſion of God, as it ſhall have hereafter; as may appear by thoſe prementioned places, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.43. and 25.34. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7.8. and this we Pray for, when we ſay, <hi>Thy Kingdome come:</hi> or, <hi>Come Lord Ieſus, come quickly:</hi> Or with our Mother the Church, <hi>That we, and all other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted in the Faith of thy holy name, may have our perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of bleſſedneſſe in thine everlaſting Kingdom.</hi> So that with theſe, the proviſion here made, and the perfection here aſſigned, is not preſent, but future; To which purpoſe, it is obſervable, there is a two-fold proviſion, or perfection of the Body, the Church: One, (as I may terme it) meritorious, which was the <hi>perfect</hi> oblation of our <hi>Redeemer;</hi> and ſo this <hi>perfection</hi> and <hi>proviſion</hi> here was procured, and purchaſed by the price of his blood on the Croſſe. The other is formall and finall, which is the ſeizure and poſſeſſion of that purchaſe, and the happy conſequent thereof, the advancement of our being into the higheſt pitch of <hi>perfection</hi> and <hi>excellency</hi> our nature is capable of; and this we obtain not, till the laſt day, when both Soules and Bodies ſhall be compleatly glorified with Chriſt our Head: The former is the <hi>perfection</hi> of the means; The latter, of the <hi>End.</hi> And that this latter is here underſtood, we have theſe Reaſons to perſwade.</p>
